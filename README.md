# updated-payroll-tracker

For this assignment we received some code that was already completed and needed to add our own code to make the website complete. 

We added a window prompt(s) that asked for an employee's first name, last name, and their salary. Once enetered, a window was then prompted to ask if they wanted to continue or cancel. This information logged all the input. 

We then added code that took the information that was submitted and got the average of the salaries that were entered. 

We also added the ability to have a random employee selected.
